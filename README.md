# Lagrangian Neural Networks for Pendulum Dynamics

This repository implements **Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs)** and provides a framework for their **training, optimization, and analysis** on simple pendulum systems. The goal is to leverage physics-informed machine learning to better capture the dynamics of mechanical systems compared to traditional black-box neural networks.

## 🚀 Concepts Used

### 1. Lagrangian Mechanics
- Classical mechanics describes systems using the **Lagrangian**:  
  L(q, q̇) = T(q̇) − V(q)  
  where `T` is kinetic energy and `V` is potential energy.  
- The **Euler–Lagrange equations** yield the equations of motion:  
  d/dt (∂L/∂q̇) − ∂L/∂q = 0.  
- This approach guarantees **energy-consistent dynamics**, unlike unconstrained neural nets.

### 2. Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs)
- Instead of predicting accelerations directly, the network **learns the Lagrangian** from data.  
- From the learned Lagrangian, accelerations are derived using the Euler–Lagrange equations.  
- This ensures predictions **respect conservation laws** and exhibit better physical generalization.

### 3. Optimization & Training
- Implemented in `Training.py` using standard ML workflows:
  - Forward pass: compute predicted dynamics.
  - Loss function: MSE between predicted and true accelerations/trajectories.
  - Backward pass: gradients via autograd.
  - Optimizer: Adam/SGD updates model parameters.
- Regularization may be applied to stabilize training.

### 4. Testing & Evaluation
- `Testing.py` runs evaluation of models on test trajectories.  
- Metrics include trajectory error, energy conservation, and phase-space reconstruction quality.  
- Comparisons between standard Neural Networks and LNNs highlight advantages of physics-informed learning.

### 5. Simulation
- `Simulation.py` uses trained models to simulate pendulum dynamics.  
- Can roll out trajectories forward in time and compare with ground-truth ODE solutions.  
- Demonstrates long-term stability of LNN predictions versus standard neural networks.

### 6. Model Comparison
- `Model_Comparison.ipynb` runs experiments comparing:
  - Standard Neural Networks (black-box).  
  - Lagrangian Neural Networks (physics-informed).  
- Provides plots of loss curves, predicted vs. true trajectories, and conserved energy analysis.

## 🧠 Key Ideas Reinforced
- Neural networks can approximate dynamical systems, but **physics-informed architectures** (LNNs) perform better.  
- Lagrangian formalism ensures learned dynamics respect conservation laws.  
- LNNs are more robust to extrapolation and long-term simulations.  
- Applications extend beyond pendulums to **robotics, molecular dynamics, and physics simulations**.

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Extend experiments to **double pendulums** and chaotic systems.  
- Add **Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs)** for comparison.  
- Use advanced optimization (e.g., symplectic integrators, physics-informed loss terms).  
- Integrate logging and visualization with TensorBoard or Weights & Biases.
